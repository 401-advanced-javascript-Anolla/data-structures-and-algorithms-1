# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
I used a for loop that iterates over the array and an if statement.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Creating which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key, returns the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I divided the array in half then I joined the two halfs by using concat

## Solution
